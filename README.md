# DID

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enable verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. DIDs are designed to be fully decentralized, allowing individuals and entities to create and manage their own identifiers without relying on a central authority.

This will closely follow the [W3C DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
